################# RUNNING PARAMETERS

#	Number of cpu cores to be used in the experiment. The default value is 4.
#cores = 4

#	Gym task to be performed. The default value is CartPole-v1.
task: MountainCar-v0

#	Max number of steps allowed in the gym environment per evaluation. The default value is 500.
#timeout = 500

#	Number of episodes to evaluate each individual. The default value is 3.
#episodes = 3

#	Number of generations to evolve the population. The default value is 25.
generations = 30

#	Number of experiment loops. The default value is 2.
repetitions = 500

################# LEARNING PARAMETERS

#	The learning process can be done either by BackPropagation or BaTch.
#	The values allowed are N/A, BP or BT. The default value is N/A.
learning_function = BP

#	Depending on the learning function, the learning rate means different things.
#	For the backpropagation algorithm, the learning rate is the typical parameter
#	that regulates how much we're moving on the opposite direction of the gradient.
#	For the batch algorithm, the learning rate refers to how close to the solution
#	we want the final weights to be.
#	The values allowed are in the interval (0.0; 1.0]. The default value is 0.1.
learning_rate = 0.10

#	We're able to choose the targets of the learning process.
#	The values allowed are Pais, Filhos or Ambos. The default value is Ambos.
learning_target = Filhos

#	If children are supposed to learn, we can choose whether they start learning
#	in the beginning of the evolutionary process or half way.
#	The values allowed are Inicial or Tardia. The default value is Tardia.
children_inclusion = Inicial

#	The lessons to be learned can be generated randomly or from memories of
#	the best individual in the population.
#	The values allowed are EXP or RND. The default value is EXP.
syllabus_source = RND

#	The size of the syllabus can have a heavy impact on the results of the
#	evolutionary process. Use this attribute to set the maximum size of the syllabus.
#	The values allowed are greater than 0. The default value is 30.
#syllabus_size = 30
